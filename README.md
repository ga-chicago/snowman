# snowman

**Do you want to build a snowman?** This is the repository for the GA Chicago Team Lunch on 9/17.

## Our Goal

We will discover the secret of the snowmen and how they are built. We must adventure together from the shores of Summeria to the highest peaks of Chiberia to find the answers we seek. Along the way, we will find HTML5 elements that will lead the way to building our fluffy friends. By the end, we will embrace the coming winter by building your own snowman!

## Instructions

**Clone** this repository to your computer somewhere. Then, open `snowman.html` in your web browser. Follow along with the team to learn to build your own snowman!
